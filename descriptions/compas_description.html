  <p><b>Goal:</b></p>
  <p>The goal of analyzing the COMPAS dataset is to predict the likelihood of a defendant re-offending within two years based on their demographic information and criminal history.</p>
<p>There will be <b>10 classification tasks</b> following, where the time taken for each task is important. Please proceed efficiently.</p>
