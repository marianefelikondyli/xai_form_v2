<p>The Play Tennis dataset is a simple and classic example used in machine learning to demonstrate decision tree algorithms. This dataset contains information about weather conditions and whether or not tennis was played on a given day. The goal is to predict if tennis will be played based on certain weather conditions.</p>
<p><b>Attributes:</b></p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>

    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Outlook</b></td>
    <td>The weather outlook, which can be 'Sunny', 'Overcast', or 'Rain' (categorical).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

<p><b>Goal:</b></p>
<p>Whether tennis was played or not, represented as 'Yes' or 'No'.</p>

<p>In this example, you will be given various weather conditions, and your task is to determine whether tennis will be played based on the provided decision tree. Please analyze the decision tree carefully and classify each sample accordingly.</p>
<p>Before starting the classification task, <b>please use the zoom functionality</b> to examine the decision tree and understand how it works.</p>
<p>Remember, <b>this is an example</b> Take all the time necessary to get familiar with the process</p>
