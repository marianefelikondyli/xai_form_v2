  <p><b>Goal:</b></p>
  <p>The goal of analyzing the Framingham Heart Study dataset is to predict the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) based on various health and demographic attributes. This prediction helps in assessing the risk and taking preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of developing CHD.</p>
  <p>There will be <b>10 classification tasks</b> following, where the time taken for each task is important. Please proceed efficiently.</p>
