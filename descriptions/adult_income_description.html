<p>The Adult Income dataset, also known as the Census Income dataset, is used to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 based on various demographic and employment attributes. This dataset is often used in classification tasks to analyze income distribution and socio-economic factors.</p>

  <p><b>Goal:</b></p>
  <p>The goal of analyzing the Adult Income dataset is to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 based on their demographic and employment attributes. This prediction helps in understanding the factors that contribute to higher income and addressing socio-economic disparities.</p>
