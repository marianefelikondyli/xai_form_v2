<p>Thank you for participating in our research survey! This study is part of a thesis project focused on Explainable AI, specifically exploring decision trees.</p>
<p>In this survey, you will be represented with <b>4 different datasets.</b></p>
<p>For each dataset you will be provided by a description and a decision tree will be displayed.</p>
<p>Your task is to classify <b>10 samples</b> of the dataset based on the decision tree displayed.</p>
<p><b>Only during the classification tasks, we will measure the time taken for each classification. Please proceed efficiently and avoid unnecessary delays.</b></b></p>
<p>Please take as much time as you need to read the descriptions of the datasets.</p>
<p>After that you will be asked to measure the confidence of your answers, the trust you have in the model and provide a small description of the model.</p>
<p>Feel free to add any comments you want!</p>
<p>Your participation in this survey is <b>entirely voluntary.</b> You are free to stop at any time without any consequences. There is no reward or profit for participating in this survey. </p>
<p>Your responses will greatly contribute to our research and understanding of Explainable AI.</p>
