<p>In the decision tree, you may encounter nodes with splits that include a category labeled <b>"Other"</b>. This category represents any value that is not explicitly listed in the other split categories. For example, if you see a node with the attribute "Temperature" and splits into "Hot" and "Other," any temperature value that is not "Hot" should follow the "Other" branch.</p>
<p>Example of classification data:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <th>Outlook</th>
      <th>Temperature</th>
      <th>Humidity</th>
      <th>Windy</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sunny</td>
      <td>Hot</td>
      <td>High</td>
      <td>False</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
